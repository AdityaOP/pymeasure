Contributions to the instrument repository (adding new instruments and methods) and the main code base are strongly encouraged. Since the code is hosted on GitHub, contributions should be added by `forking a repository`_ and `submitting a pull request`_. To ensure consistency, follow the :doc:`coding standards for PyMeasure <coding_standards>`.
