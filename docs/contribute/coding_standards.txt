Coding Standards
================

In order to maintain consistency across the different instruments in the PyMeasure repository, we enforce the following standards.

Python style guides
###################

Python 3 is used in PyMeasure. The `PEP8 style guide`_ and `PEP257 docstring conventions`_ should be followed.

.. _PEP8 style guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
.. _PEP257 docstring conventions: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

Function and variable names should be lower case with underscores as needed to seperate words. Camel case should not be used, unless working with Qt, where it is common.

Standard naming
###############

Since many instruments have similar functions, a few naming conventions have been adopted to make the interface more consistent.


Using a buffer

  set_buffer
  wait_for_buffer
  get_buffer
