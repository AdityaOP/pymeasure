Using a graphical interface
###########################

In the previous tutorial we measured the IV characteristic of a sample to show how we can set up a simple experiment in PyMeasure. The real power of PyMeasure comes when we also use the graphical tools that are included to turn our simple example into a full-flegged user interface.


Plotting data in a graphical interface is easily achieved with the Plotter object. The Plotter takes a Results object and plots the data at a regular interval, grabbing the latest data each time from the file.

Let's extend our SimpleProcedure with a RandomProcedure, which generates random numbers during our loop. ::

    import logging
    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    log.addHandler(logging.NullHandler())

    import random
    from time import sleep
    from pymeasure.log import console_log
    from pymeasure.experiment import Procedure, Results, Worker
    from pymeasure.experiment import IntegerParameter, FloatParameter, Parameter

    class RandomProcedure(Procedure):

        iterations = IntegerParameter('Loop Iterations')
        delay = FloatParameter('Delay Time', units='s', default=0.2)
        seed = Parameter('Random Seed', default='12345')

        DATA_COLUMNS = ['Iteration', 'Random Number']

        def startup(self):
            log.info("Setting the seed of the random number generator")
            random.seed(self.seed)

        def execute(self):
            log.info("Starting the loop of %d iterations" % self.iterations)
            for i in range(self.iterations):
                data = {
                    'Iteration': i,
                    'Random Number': random.random()
                }
                self.emit('results', data)
                log.debug("Emitting results: %s" % data)
                sleep(self.delay)
                if self.should_stop():
                    log.warning("Caught the stop flag in the procedure")
                    break


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        console_log(log)

        log.info("Constructing a SimpleProcedure")
        procedure = SimpleProcedure()
        procedure.iterations = 100

        data_filename = 'random.csv'
        log.info("Constructing the Results with a data file: %s" % data_filename)
        results = Results(procedure, data_filename)

        log.info("Constructing the Plotter")
        plotter = Plotter(results)
        plotter.start()
        log.info("Started the Plotter")

        port = 5888
        log.info("Constructing the Worker on port: %d" % port)
        worker = Worker(results, port=port)
        worker.start()
        log.info("Started the Worker")

        log.info("Joining with the worker in at most 1 hr")
        worker.join(timeout=3600) # wait at most 1 hr (3600 sec)
        log.info("Finished the measurement")

The important addition is the construction of the Plotter from the Results object. ::

    plotter = Plotter(results)
    plotter.start()

Just like the Worker, the Plotter is started in a different process so that it can be run on a separate CPU for higher performance. The Plotter launches a Qt graphical interface using pyqtgraph which allows the Results data to be viewed based on the columns in the data.
